The computer is configured as a Coordinator with Destination Address Low and High as both 0 and with my Source Address as 1. Channel ID: C PAN ID: 3332 All other entries are as default.

All receiver XBees are configured identically with the only change being Source Address is 0 and Destination Low as 1.

To setup the computer, use XCTU to import the computer settings file and for the robots, use the computer settings file and set Source Address to 0 and Destination Low to 1.
